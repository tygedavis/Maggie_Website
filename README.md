## Welcome!

This is a website that I'm making for my wonderfuly wife Maggie. 

She's an aspiring interior decorator and we wanted to give her a website that would give her some internet presence.

**Built using** React and JavaScript.

I didn't see a need to use Redux for state since this is mostly a static site and doesn't use much state at all.

Of course there is some JavaScript and it is all *completely* styled with vanilla CSS.

The contact form backend is actually an NPM Package called [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/).
If your building a site that doesn't need much of a backend but you want a contact form, I highly recommend this package!
